## Dashboard for Real-Estate Brokers
### [Incomplete Version Live Here](https://agitated-agnesi-61b85f.netlify.com/)

I am building this for a friend.  

## Progress 
Minimally complete user interface.  
Notes functionality in notes.js

## Challenges:  
I hit a roadblock while trying to dynamically render html templates in javascript.  
I was using npm parcel-bundler. I could probably configure webpack to do this.  
However, I am going to try setting up node.js and express for this project,  
And turn everything into a module.  

Will updae with progress!
